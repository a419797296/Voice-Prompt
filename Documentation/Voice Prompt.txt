                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an

                property for limitations).
   - LIGHT_BAR_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to 
                a memory or a register, this value will be written to the pins after switching to the output mode - using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to
